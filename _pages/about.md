I am a Computer Science PhD student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. My research focuses on Security and Privacy in Machine Learning. I am also interested in applications of Machine Learning in Bioinformatics. I am fortunate to be working with Hari Sundaram and Varun Chandrasekaran.

More specifically, I am interested in designing methods that increase the robustness of deep learning models to adversarial and non-adversarial noise. I am also interested in topics related to privacy, such as machine unlearning and its verification.
